Barebones
===
Barebones is my personal base Rails application. After developing a
couple of Rails applications, I thought that there were some common
gems and patterns that would be nice to have out of the box.

For now, just run ./bin/barebones [AppName]

Barebones includes various preconfigured gems such as:
####File Uploading

####Dev/Testing
* Byebug

Barebones requires the latest version of Ruby (2.2.2), Rails (4.2.3), and
PostgreSQL (9.4) on your local machine.
